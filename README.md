 ### DataAnalytics-Assessment
### Question 1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products ###
Approach:
To find customers with both a funded savings and a funded investment plan, we join the `users_customuser`, `savings_savingsaccount`, and `plans_plan` tables.
Filtering ensures each plan is funded by checking `confirmed_amount > 0`. We count each plan type, group by customer, and calculate total deposits (converted from kobo to naira).

### Question 2: Transaction Frequency Analysis ###
Approach:
We compute transaction frequency by first summarizing transaction counts per customer per month.
Then we calculate each customerâ€™s average monthly transaction count and classify them into frequency buckets.
Finally, we count the number of customers in each category and their average transaction frequency.

### Question 3: Account Inactivity Alert ###
Approach
We flag accounts without activity in the last 365 days using `last_transaction_date`.
We determine the account type using flags (`is_regular_savings`, `is_a_fund`) and calculate days since the last transaction.

### Question 4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation ###
Approach:
We compute tenure as months since `date_joined`, count total transactions, and calculate average transaction value.
Estimated CLV uses the formula CLV = (total_transactions / tenure) * 12 * avg_profit_per_transaction.
All monetary values are converted from kobo to naira.
